Launch start.py it will return Yte.csv containing the labels of the test set.

It uses the Gram matrices computed locally for k_spectrum = 10 (K_0_10.npy, K_1_10.npy K_2_10.npy) instead of recalculating them which is long.
You can modify that in the code by commenting/decommenting it if you change k_spectrum.
